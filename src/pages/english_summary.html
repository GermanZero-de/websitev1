<p>Our mission is a climate-neutral Germany by 2035 at the latest.</p>
<p>We will deliver a 1.5° legislative package including a CO2 tax reform, a comprehensive
    package of measures and climate protection to be anchored in the Basic Law.
    Is climate protection a job for professionals? We are building up this reputation and, together
    with thousands of taxpayers, are building up the necessary pressure to ensure that the 2022
    1.5° legislative package is passed with a 2/3 majority in the Bundestag. This is the first and
    last chance to turn the tide.</p>
<br/>
<p class="title title--size-h3">
    Our job
</p>
<p>
    We must act now to prevent the worst from happening. We will no longer tolerate destroying
    our prosperity and the future of our children.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, we cannot expect the current federal government and members of parliament
    to suddenly take the 1.5° target seriously and adopt a binding policy of climate neutrality by
    2035. Even the manageable target of reducing 40 percent by 2020 was simply cancelled
    because it had not been achieved. Apart from cosmetic corrections, there are no signs of the
    necessary turnaround.
</p>
<p>
    But the climate crisis is not waiting for us. And we are not waiting any longer. Instead, we
    will now take it into our own hands and provide for the 1.5° legislative package. Otherwise no
    one will do it. If a consistent climate protection course is not decided by the new Bundestag in
    2022 at the latest, it will certainly be too late in 2025. The consequences of the climate crisis
    will then be catastrophic and above all irreversible.
</p>
<p>
    For decades now, thousands of citizens, hundreds of associations and societies have been
    working against the destruction of our planet and thus of our livelihoods. Recently, the
    Hambacher Forst Movement, Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion were added. They
    deserve our thanks and respect.
</p>
<p>
    But an additional force is needed that will unfold a new vehemence, win the majority of the
    population for the last attempt and thus strengthen the back of politics for the right decisions.
    This is what we are. What we are now pushing is democracy from below in its purest form.
    As citizens, we will work out the 1.5° legislative package ourselves. We will help the parties
    and politicians to keep their promise to the 1.5°. Politics will have to face up to our content:
    We will convince every member of the Bundestag to take responsibility for our future and to
    vote for the 1.5° law.
</p>
<p>
    Because if we do not lead politics and media into the discussion now thoroughly, but
    respectfully and with convincing arguments, our children and grandchildren will ask us in
    three decades an unpleasant question: Why didn&#39;t we become active with all our possibilities
    when we could?
</p>
<p>
    Become part of this new movement and help us, support us on a voluntary basis, financially
    with a donation or as a multiplier with reach.

<p class="title title--size-h3">
    Our 1.5° law
</p>
<p>
    A 1.5° law provides for clear conditions: for or against the future of our children, for or
    against the preservation of our civilization, for or against climate protection. We will sharpen
    this decision so that no one can escape it.
</p>
<p>
    The legislative package contains three components:
</p>
<div class="title title--size-h4">
    1. state goal climate neutrality
</div>
<p>
    Climate neutrality must be enshrined as a fundamental right in the first 20 articles of the Basic
    Law. No other law and no state action may contravene this fundamental right.
</p>
<div class="title title--size-h4">
    2. fossil taxes
</div>
<p>
    Change course with taxes: If the prices for oil, gas and coal rise, we will be able to decide
    more easily at the counter: cheap for climate-friendly, expensive for climate-damaging. The
    economy, too, will automatically switch to clean production and products, whereas climate-
    damaging offers will become shopkeepers. Innovative technologies and solutions will
    blossom and the right investments will ensure new prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    The tax revenues generated by CO2 pricing also act as an important lever on the road to
    climate neutrality. They can be used to finance the turnaround in key areas such as transport,
    energy or agriculture sufficiently quickly. The social or structural disadvantages that result
    must be offset. It is about fair climate protection for all. There will be changes in mobility
    behaviour, energy consumption and consumption at all.
</p>
<p>
    Last but not least, CO2 pricing offers us the chance that the former export world champion
    Germany will once again develop into a global pioneer for new, climate-neutral prosperity.
    Only a few other countries in the world still have a largely intact democracy and a strong civil
    society like Germany - and thus the best prerequisites for action. As the fourth-largest
    economy in the world, we have both the opportunity and the obligation. If Germany moves,
    imitators worldwide will follow.
</p>
<div class="title title--size-h4">
    3. Climate Law
</div>
<p>
    For the changeover of our economy and society to climate neutrality, we need a
    comprehensive legislative package which, for example, regulates a change of traffic in the
    country and city, a forced energy turnaround with coal closing by 2035 at the latest or
    subsidies for climate-neutral heating systems and numerous other measures.
</p>
<p>
    We will draw up this law ourselves - using the Citizens&#39; Council method. This original
    democratic instrument has proved its worth in many countries. It serves to develop a social
    consensus not by forming opinions but facts with the support of experts in an intensive
    dialogue. Here, representative drawn citizens from the entire population, from all parties and
    from all milieus gather - whether AfD or Green voters, young or old, woman or man, poor or
    wealthy, city or country. We will use this instrument to develop an enforceable climate law
    with fair climate protection rules for all.
</p>
<br/>
<div class="title title--size-h4">
    Who we are
</div>
<p>
    Since August 2019, over 50 people have been volunteering to make the 1.5° law come true.
    The goal is to build a powerful, professional campaign supported by thousands of committed
    citizens in a short period of time. The initiative for GermanZero was taken by Heinrich
    Strößenreuther, who cracked the traffic turn in Berlin from below and triggered a nationwide
    wave of municipal cycling decisions. Meanwhile not only celebrities like Axel Prahl, Charly
    Hübner, Christiane Paul or Lars Jessen support the initiative, but also multiplicators from
    science or NGOs.
</p>
<p>
    GermanZero can use any help - including yours! We are constantly looking for supporters
    who want to help or contribute financially within their means. In fact, this plan will only
    succeed if we raise well over 10 million euros in funding in the summer; a fraction of the cost
    of election advertising for the parties in the last Bundestag election or the millions spent on
    PR agencies and their work. We have already been able to raise the first half million on a
    single evening in October. If you, like us, are convinced that we have to act now - on course
    for the first and last chance by 2022 at the latest - then contact us or donate via
